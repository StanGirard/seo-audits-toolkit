# Open source SEO Audits Toolkit

**OSAT** is a collection of multiple tools to help you in your quest for a better SEO. All of these tools have been grouped into a single web app.

I've grown tired of SEO agencies making us pay hundreds of euros for simple tools. So,I decided to develop **OSAT** to help users find issues in their website and increase their SEO for free. Here are some advantages please check it out.
