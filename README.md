# Open source Audits Toolkit

**OSAT** is a collection of tools created help you in your quest for a better website. All of these tools have been grouped into a single web app.

I've grown tired of SEO agencies making us pay hundreds of euros for simple tools. I decided to develop **OSAT** to help users find issues on their website and increase their SEO for free.
